This directory contains a build tree for gr-dmx.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.

To build the examples from the tarball run these commands:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ../
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  $ sudo ldconfig

Then use GNU-Radio-Companion to open one of the example-apps
within gr-dmx/apps
  
Additional notes
----------------

Presently this DMX driver can only be used under Linux.

It depends on the USB DMX Module https://github.com/lowlander/dmx_usb_module

The output-stream is hardcoded to be /dev/dmx1.
Eventually you need to change this to become /dev/dmx0
It can be changed within gr-dmx/python/dmx.py

The current version controls up to 3 LED groups on DMX adresses
(RGB RGB RGB): 1,2,3  7,8,9  13,14,15.

The update-rate is fixed at 50Hz. 
The python module runs at a slightly hier rate to ensure
proper synchronization to the GNU-Radio blockset.

For an example to use the driver have a look at gr-dmx/apps
